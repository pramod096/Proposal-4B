 <h1> <p align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS </p></h1> 

You, ***Featured Location*** are hiring ***PN Solutions*** located in Maryville, Missouri to design and develop a website for the estimated total price of $40,000 outlined in our previous correspondence. 

As our customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide us with everything that we need to complete the project including text, images, fonts and other information as and when we need it, and in the format that we ask for. You agree to review our work, provide feedback, and sign-off approval in a timely manner and are bound by any deadlines that we set together. You also agree to keep to the payment schedule set out in this proposal.

We have the experience and ability to perform the services you need and we will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. We will endeavour to meet all the deadlines set but are not responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved my work on time at any stage. We will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.

#### Details of the works

We will create designs for the look, layout, and functionality of your website. This contract includes one main design and two opportunities for you to make revisions to the final design. If you are not happy with the design at that point, We will provide you with an additional quote for extra design work needed. If instead, you wish to cancel our agreement, you may do so and We will retain the initial payment for the work completed to date.

#### HTML/CSS layout templates

We will develop using valid HTML5 markup and CSS3 for styling. We will test all our markup and CSS in current versions of all major browsers including those made by Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, Google and Opera. We will also test to ensure that pages will display visually in a similar—not necessarily an identical—way in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 for Windows as this browser is now past its sell-by date.

We will not test these templates in old or abandoned browsers, for example, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 or 6 for Windows or Mac, previous versions of Apple's Safari, Mozilla Firefox or Opera unless otherwise specified.


#### Changes and revisions

The estimate/quotation prices in this proposal are based on the time we estimate we will need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve. If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates, or even add new functionality, that won't be a problem. At that time you will be provided with an additional quote for the extra work.


#### Legal

We are not liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this website and any other web pages—even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

#### Copyrights

You guarantee to me that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the website are either owned by you or that you have permission to use them.

When I receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

You own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project. We will give you a copy of all files and you should store them carefully as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that I used in making them.

You also own text content, photographs, and other data you provided unless someone else owns them. We own the HTML markup, CSS, and other code and we license it to you for use on only this project.

We also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of our portfolio and to write about the project on websites, in magazine articles, and in books.

#### Payments

As agreed, our payment schedule will be as follows but may be revised based on further conversations between us.

20% of total fee upon agreement of initial design.

30% of total on delivery of the website.

50% of total fee on completion of the project.

Interest accrued if payment is more than 14 days late. We reserve the right to add 5% any outstanding balance every 7 days, starting from 15th day after receipt of the finished product.


***You cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.***
