 <h1> <p align="center">FEATURED LOCATION PROPOSAL </p></h1> 

## Introduction

* The objective is to develop a Progressive Web Application that looks good on any device. The application is a City Guide for Maryville, which offers users with essential city information and also saves time.

## Process & Schedule

* The Schedule is based on Sprints and every Sprint consist of a 2 week period. Each process is scheduled to be completed in 1 Sprint.

#### Sprint 1. Gather Requirements

* We need to get to the bottom of what you need and what you stand for. Only then can we begin to create a design that portrays the value you offer in a way that resonates with the people who matter: the users of your application.

#### Sprint 2. Design presentation

* A new design concept will be presented as per your sketches, using Front-end Frameworks as Vue.js and Bootstrap. Naturally there will be a common theme but we try to think outside the box and come up with something that isn't obvious. This is often where the best ideas come from. 

* We'll go through this design and decide which direction to take and any adjustments.
