 <h1> <p align="center">FEATURED LOCATION PROPOSAL </p></h1> 

## Introduction

* The objective is to develop a Progressive Web Application that looks good on any device. The application is a City Guide for Maryville, which offers users with essential city information and also saves time.

## Process & Schedule

* The Schedule is based on Sprints and every Sprint consist of a 2 week period. Each process is scheduled to be completed in 1 Sprint.

#### Sprint 1. Gather Requirements

* We need to get to the bottom of what you need and what you stand for. Only then can we begin to create a design that portrays the value you offer in a way that resonates with the people who matter: the users of your application.

#### Sprint 2. Design presentation

* A new design concept will be presented as per your sketches, using Front-end Frameworks as Vue.js and Bootstrap. Naturally there will be a common theme but we try to think outside the box and come up with something that isn't obvious. This is often where the best ideas come from. 

* We'll go through this design and decide which direction to take and any adjustments.

#### Sprint 3. Website Build

* Using everything we've gathered, your website is built with the initial home page using Node.js for the Back-end and the database is created for the Application. At this point the data can be accessed dynamically from the database. Once it's done, we'll present it to you and go through the details in accordance with the objectives originally set.

* Any amends are made at this stage.

#### Sprint 4. Testing and Installation

* The features developed until now are tested and the application is hosted on Heroku and will be able to run on any device. Any issues with the deployment will be resolved and the application will be ready for furthur development during next semester.
